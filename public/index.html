      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

            Web Developer - Entrepeneur - Adventurer&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>Welcome to my site! This has been a long time coming, and there's still a lot more to go. I've got so much on my plate to learn to be able to enter the market for web development for small businesses that I've overlooked the need for a sufficient portfolio site for myself. Honestly the only need for a portfolio site up until this point was to showcase what kind of developer I am to potential employers, and I've been quite un-motivated to seek such a thing. At this very point in my existence I no longer think that this site is a window for potential employers, instead this is the next steps in the journey I began when I was 17. This window into my personal projects and other doings is for people to view me, not my working-productivity potential. </p>
          <p> From the moment this site successfully goes live, I am no longer putting together projects that make me look hireable. I want to build a community around the skateboarders in my area, one that bands together to not only keep the parks clean but to actively work to maintain and improve upon what we have. I want to do the same community building for moutain bike trails, rock climbing location, apartment complexes, and anything else I have the capacity to work towards. The power of the internet is incredible at connecting humans, and I want to work to decentralize our attention from traditional electronic methods of gathering and sharing info such as on mainstream social media platforms. I love to work on bikes and I want to some day organize a community bike shop that restores and sells bikes in partnership with a non-profit in DC called Gearin' Up DC. Depending on the success of that I would try to do that in the future in KCMO when I move back. I have dreams of starting for-profit businesses as well, but those are plans I'm not so keen on publishing just yet. ;) </p>

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>I am employed as a Software Engineer, but that's the least interesting thing about me. I'm an avid outdoorsman with a long list of places to explore, I love to go camping with good friends. I like to participate in action sports, mostly mountain biking and skateboarding but I'd never pass up a good opportunity to go skiing or rock climbing. I dabble as a musician, mostly ukulele and whistling for now but when finances and time are of no consequence I'll be diving into anything and everything.</p>
